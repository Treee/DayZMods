        <p>Warmth</p>
        <p>
            Fire making, Shelter, Proper clothing Maintaining a proper body temperature is key to survival here in the Bitterroot Valley. The nights can be chilly even in summer and as you go higher in elevation, the
            temperature drop becomes quite extreme. Hypothermia is a real danger in these lands.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you travel the lands, you should always be on the looked for warm clothing. The better the clothing, the warmer you will be. Keeping your clothes dry is also important. Some can be wrung out as you sit
            around a fire to warm your core. Stay out of the rain as best you can, but if you need to travel in the elements, keep an eye on how you feel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gather wood to make a fire. Small sticks and logs are best. Bark, paper or rags can be used as kindling. If you don't have matches or a lighter, you can make a hand drill that is very effective in getting a
            flame going. To make a hand drill, combine a small stick and some bark. Holding a torch while traveling will also keep you warm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the buildings you come across to get out of the weather and keep a little warmer. Some dwellings even have a fireplace or small stove. Keep an eye on the door. The infected in this area have figured out
            how to open them.
        </p>
        <p>Food</p>
        <p>
            Fishing, Hunting, Farming, Foraging Since the fall, game has remained plentiful and the lakes and streams are full of fish. Vegetables grow easily and foraging can yield enough to keep your belly full.
            Staying well fed is key to staying healthy in the Valley.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make a fishing rod, gather a long stick and find or make a rope. You can make rope by weaving stacks of rags or fashion some from the guts of a kill with your knife. To make a hook you can carve it out of
            a stick or bones. Dig up some worms and you are in business. The carp in the Valley are delicious and filling.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are usually still a few packs of old seeds stashed in farm areas and in greenhouses. If the seeds are still viable you can plant them and reap delicious vegetables. Till the soil in a greenhouse or dig
            a plot on a suitable piece of land. Planting the see and adding some water will do the trick, but if you can find some fertilizer and disinfectant, you can increase your yield. You can use old plants, lime or
            bone meal as fertilizer.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you travel the valley you will come across the scat of the various wildlife in the Valley. Study it closely to start tracking the animal. If you look even closer, you can get an idea of how fresh the scat
            is and how long it will take to find the beast. Study the tracks. Focus. *OOC-go into first person and tap the keypad 2 key* Your vision will darken and sound will dampen and you will see tracks that show the
            way. Continue finding sign until you see the animal you seek. As you gain hunting experience, you will develop more skills that help you.
        </p>
        <p>If you happen upon a swarm of insects, follow them. They may lead you to some edible forage.</p>
        <p>Water</p>
        <p>
            Sources, Purifying Water is life, but here in the Bitterroot Valley, it can be your death too. Always be careful of your source. The most safe source is a well. The water coming from deep underground is
            usually safe to drink. There are also a few springs in the Valley. This water too is usually safe to drink, but treating the water is still recommended. You can draw water from lakes and streams, but you
            should always purify this with chlorine.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you find a container to carry water, always dump out any water that was in the container. This doesn't guarantee the water is safe to drink, so you should always purify the first fill in a new container.
            You can also empty the container and let it dry out for about 12 hours to make it safe for filling.
        </p>
        <p>Medical</p>
        <p>
            Illnesses, Injuries, Cures, Medicines, Herbal Remedies Life is hard since the fall. Cholera, Salmonella, Infection, Kuru all run rampant in the Valley. Even the common cold can kill you out here. Luckily
            there are still some meds around and herbal remedies can save the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm not a doctor, but here are a few tips. If you drink bad water, tetracycline or rosemary tea can help. If you ate bad food, charcoal will calm your stomach. Also mint or chamomile tea can help settle the
            stomach If you get a wound infection, you should clean the wound with alcohol or tincture. Try to always use clean, disinfected bandages or rags to bind your wounds. California Bay and Thistle tea will boost
            your immunity. Take vitamins often. Blacksage tea will speed healing.
        </p>
        <p>If you injure you leg, you can make a splint with some sticks and rags. It is hard to walk without one. Kuru is a fatal disease, so I recommend you avoid it by not eating human meat. You will go mad.</p>
