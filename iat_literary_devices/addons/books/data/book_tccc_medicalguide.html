        <p>Purpose</p>
        <p>Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) teaches how to treat injuries when help isn’t coming. Keep yourself and your team alive long enough to reach proper care.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Phases of Care</p>
        <p>There are three main phases: Care Under Fire, Tactical Field Care, Evacuation Care.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Care Under Fire</p>
        <p>Stay in the fight. Return fire and move to cover. Shout for the wounded to crawl or find cover if able.</p>
        <p>Only treat life-threatening bleeding. Apply a tourniquet high and tight using belt, band, or strap.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Tactical Field Care</p>
        <p>Once safe, start a full assessment. Check breathing, bleeding, and responsiveness.</p>
        <p>Open the airway. For chest wounds with sucking sounds, seal with plastic or tape.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Bleeding Control</p>
        <p>Use direct pressure or a tourniquet. If the first tourniquet fails, apply a second above it. Pack deep wounds with cloth and maintain pressure.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Airway & Breathing</p>
        <p>If unconscious but breathing, place casualty on side to prevent choking. If breathing stops, start rescue breaths only if safe.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Circulation & Shock</p>
        <p>Keep the casualty warm. Shock kills quietly. Use jacket, tarp, or blanket to retain heat.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Evacuation Care</p>
        <p>Prepare casualty for movement. Re-check bandages and tourniquets. Record what you did — tourniquet times, wounds treated, meds if any — and pass info along.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Priorities for Evac</p>
        <p>Secure casualty — prevent further harm. Monitor breathing continuously. Control bleeding before transport. Keep warm and hydrated.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Improvised Tools</p>
        <p>Tourniquet: Belt, torn clothing, rope. Pressure bandage: Shirt, rag, scarf. Chest seal: Plastic wrap, tape, bag. Splint: Stick, board, rifle barrel.</p>
        <br />

        <p>First Aid Tips</p>
        <p>Talk to the casualty — it helps keep them conscious. Reassess every few minutes. Stop bleeding and keep them breathing.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Environmental Awareness</p>
        <p>Move casualty out of exposed areas when possible. Avoid cold, wet, or unsafe terrain. Medical priorities come first; equipment is secondary.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Prioritize Life over Loot</p>
        <p>Medical priorities come first. Stop bleeding and maintain airway before gathering supplies.</p>
        <br />

        <p>Final Notes</p>
        <p><em>“You are the medic until one arrives.”</em></p>
        <p>Stay calm. Keep casualty breathing, warm, and monitored until evacuation or help arrives.</p>
